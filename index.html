                        unemployed and didn't really do well in school. <br> <br>
                        I'm relatively small for a girl my age, probably due to genetics and health, at the moment I
                        weight around
                        39kg but I try improving it when I can. <br> <br> I'm currently unemployed, but I live
                        with my GF who provides for me. I do the cleaning and cooking.</p>
